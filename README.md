# BaD-2024
# File Upload and Statistics App

This is a simple web application for uploading a file, processing its contents, and displaying statistics on the webpage.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

## Installation

npm install

## Start server
npm start
## Start client
Alternatively, if you are using a local server for the client, open the index.html file directly in your browser or use your preferred method for serving static files (e.g., VS Code Live Server, Python's SimpleHTTPServer, etc.).

Choose a file using the file input.
Click the "Upload File" button.
View the processed statistics on the webpage.
Note
The server logs can be checked for details on the file processing. The results are stored in the temp/results.txt file.
